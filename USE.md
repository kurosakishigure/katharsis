# Use the Katharsis

## Prerequisites

### Linux and macOS

First, download the appropriate binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/kurosakishigure/katharsis/releases) page.

Next, execute the following command in your home directory to create the necessary folders:

```bash
mkdir -p Formulae/bin
```

Move the downloaded binary to ~/Formulae/bin:

```bash
mv ~/your/download/path/katharsis ~/Formulae/bin/katharsis
```

Modify your .zshrc or .bashrc file by adding the following configuration:

```bash
# Formulae
export PATH=$HOME/Formulae/bin:$PATH
```

You can also add an alias in the .zshrc or .bashrc file:

```bash
alias rss=katharsis
```

Alternatively, you can rename the binary file directly:

```bash
mv ~/Formulae/bin/katharsis ~/Formulae/bin/rss
```

Run the following command to apply the changes:

```bash
source .zshrc
# or
source .bashrc
```
