# Next.js Example

Hereâ€™s an example of building an rss.xml file with Katharsis in a Next.js project. Make sure your project meets the following requirements:

- The [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) is being used.
- The corresponding [page.tsx](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages) and [opengraph-image.png](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image) files are present.
- Run `next build` to generate the .next folder before running Katharsis.

## USE

Run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```bash
katharsis && cat rss.xml
```
